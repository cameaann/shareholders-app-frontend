# Shareholders Application

## Introduction
Managing shareholder information becomes increasingly complex as the number of transactions grows, 
leading to potential errors. Key questions arise, such as "Who owns the company?" and 
"How many shares does each owner hold?"

As shareholder transactions increase, maintaining accurate records of ownership and shares becomes more difficult. Errors in tracking share transfers, ownership details, and compliance with legal obligations like GDPR can result in serious complications.

## Application goal:
This Shareholders Management System is an open-source application designed to simplify equity and cap table management. Built with security in mind, the system ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) while providing transparency on company ownership and equity distribution.

## Key Features:

- Accurately track shareholders and their respective ownership stakes.

- Maintain comprehensive shareholder records, including name, social security number, address, and email.
- Ensure legal compliance, with the Board of the company remaining accountable for maintaining the shareholder list.

- Keep a detailed history of share transactions, including purchase dates, seller and buyer details, number of shares transferred, price, and tax reporting status.

- Monitor shares being sold, track from-to share numbers, and add relevant notes for each transaction.

- Record share issuance details such as decision IDs, dates, maximum and issued shares, and other relevant data.

- Secure handling of personal information, ensuring the application meets GDPR standards for data protection.
